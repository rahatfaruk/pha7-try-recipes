## About assignment:
**TryRecipes**. This is my assignment 7, module 43 by Programming hero. Focused on *React* fundamental.

Mainly "Our Recipes" section is functional. We load some recipes from local data; then show these. On-click want-to-cook btn inside recipe card:- we add that into want-to-cook section; if we click the btn again then a toast alert shows up. On-click preparing-btn inside want-to-cook section's recipe:- remove the recipe from want-to-cook section; add the recipe into cooking-section; update total time & calory of cooking section.
